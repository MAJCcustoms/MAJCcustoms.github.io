                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently I am attending Collin College and expect to graduate with my Associate's of Science
                    after the Fall semester of 2022. I do plan to transfer to another university to pursue a degree 
                    in engineering or product design. In between semesters I plan to obtain my A+ certificate, and work
                    as some sort of computer or electronics technician. I also have several ideas for products that I 
                    would like to bring to fruition soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests are eclectic and vary from time to time. I often find myself learning something new
                    or having an idea that requires additional knowledge and fully investing into it for weeks to months
                    at a time. Though it is not healthy, I often find myself forgetting to eat, sleep, and drink when
                    I am fully invested in a project or learning endeavor. I get so absorbed in asking myself questions
                    and challenging myself to find answers and solve problems, that I have spent many sleepless nights
                    reading manufacturing spec sheets, sifting through tutorials, reviews, and watching many long-form
                    videos about the in-depth mechanics of the topic I'm researching. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the interests that I have taken on as hobbies include prop works, electronics and 
                    electronics repair, video games, computers and computer building, 3D printing and 3D modeling, 
                    photography, and audio gear. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of these hobbies have even turned into business opportunities, and I was managing an online 
                    business doing 3D modeling, 3D printing, electronics, and prop work at the age of 14. Since then 
                    I have slowly gotten more and more busy in life and now only occasionally accept commissions when
                    I have the free time and a market to capitalize on. I am 24 as of the time of writing and have kept
                    up with my main hobbies all this time and now have quite a bit of experience in many of these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not one to hoard knowledge, or turn down a great job opportunity. If you would like to ask any
                    questions, or like my work and would like to hire or commission me, please fill out the contact form.
