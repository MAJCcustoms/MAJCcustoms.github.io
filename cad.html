                <h2>CAD / 3D Modeling</h2>
                <h3>What is it ?</h3>
                <p>
                    CAD and 3D modeling are both similar and one can argue that they mean the same things,
                    but the different terms are often used to refer to different workflows. CAD stands for
                    Computer Aided Design or Drafting and refers to a more engineering workflow where parts
                    are modeled with 2D sketches that are then manipulated into 3D objects. One of the main
                    features of CAD programs is also the ability to create manufacturing documents or spec sheets
                    easily from the model already created. CAD programs are more engineering oriented compared to
                    3D modeling programs. 3D modeling programs generally differ from CAD programs in the fact that
                    you are working in 3D at all times and the workflow can be thought of as "digital sculpting". 
                    This is a more free flowing artistic workflow. Both programs lend themselves well to different
                    tasks and I find I use both for different things.
                </p>
                <h3>Which programs do I use ?</h3>
                <p>
                    I started with SolidWorks and obtained a certificate of proficiency, but nowadays mainly use
                    Fusion360 as I feel it has a better UI and they are close to equal in terms of performance. I
                    do use Blender every now and then for very specific reasons, 
                    but CAD is the workflow that I know the most and am most comfortable 
                    with.
