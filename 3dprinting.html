                <h2>3D Printing</h2>
                <h3>What is 3D Printing?</h3>
                <p>
                    In it's most basic form, 3D printing is an additive manufacturing technique
                    where a 3d digital model is sliced into layers and instructions called gcode
                    tell the machine how to move in order to create the part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many different forms and techniques of 3D printing, but at the heart
                    of almost all, is that same idea. The reason it is "almost all" now instead of 
                    "all" is because recently there has been a lot of research done on a way of 3D
                    printing that prints the entire object in one go like the the replicator from
                    Star Trek.
                </p>
                <h3>Some of My Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I have over 10 years of experience in the field of 3D printing and started around
                    the time that the original Mendel printers were being developed and a bit before any
                    real consumer 3D printer had come around. As a kid, it was crazy to see these machines
                    take an idea that someone had thought up and designed and turn it into a real object 
                    automatically. Before I had learned of 3D printing, I was fully invested into making
                    things. But all of the things I made had to be made by hand with hard work and many
                    tweaks and design iterations along the way. Having something that did it all automatically
                    was so mesmerizing that I spent every day researching, and when the first consumer printers
                    came out, I begged my parents for one until they agreed. I ended up with a Solidoodle 4 by
                    the time they had agreed and I spent every day messing with it and modifying the parts.
                    Solidoodle eventually went out of business, but since then I had been working overtime designing,
                    printing, and modifying. A lot of my childhood revolved around 3D printing and I will always have
                    a soft spot for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience with PrusaSlicer, Cura, Simplify3D, Slic3r, and several other slicers. I am very
                    good with gcode, but have the most experience with the RepRapFW flavor. I have worked with advanced
                    materials and overcome many of the challenges that they pose. I have listed some of my standard gcode
                    settings on this page. Maybe you have use for some of it. I might eventually update this section with my printing profiles as well.
                </p>
                <h3>My Favorite 3D Printing Sites</h3>
                <p>
                    My all time favorite 3D Printing website is <a href="https://all3dp.com/" target="_blank">All3DP.com</a>, an excellent 
                    source for 3D Printing news and information. So far it is the largest source of good 3D printing
                    content I have found.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also tend to spend a lot of money on 3D printing so here are my favorite stores. 
                    <a href="https://www.printedsolid.com/" target="_blank">Printed Solid</a> and <a href="https://www.filastruder.com/" target="_blank">Filastruder</a> 
                    are both incredible stores with great customer service that carry
                    quality products. <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/" target="_blank">MatterHackers</a> is also pretty good, 
                    but I find they only really 
                    carry general stuff for weird machines or business oriented printers that have never applied to me.
                    They carry a very large amount of parts though, and I can recommend shopping there as long as there
                    is not a better price at one of the two other stores. Also, I'm not sure if they have changed in the
                    past year or two, but their filament, I always found, was inconsistent and often showed up looking
                    extremely old and not dry at all so I tend to avoid them in general now.
